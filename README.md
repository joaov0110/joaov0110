- 👋 Hi, I’m João Vitor, a software developer based on São Paulo, Brazil. I'm 23 years old and currently attending my last year on college for Computer Science.

- 👀 As a web developer i have a lot of interest on technologies from the Javascrip enviroment such as: NodeJS and some of it's frameworks like ExpressJs and Hono.
     ReactJS and VueJS for front-end are really big on me(with Typescript of course). Outside the professional aspect, i just like a friday night with some pizza, beers and videogames.

- 🌱 As of now i'm digging a little bit of Golang and Angular. For some reason, it makes a good mix for me.

- 💞️ As i have 3 years of professional experience with Nodejs and React, i'd really love to contribute with projects using these technologies but of couse
    i wouldn't refuse working with anyone of the techs listed above
